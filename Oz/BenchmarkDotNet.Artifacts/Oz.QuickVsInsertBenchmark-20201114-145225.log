// Validating benchmarks:
Assembly Oz which defines benchmarks references non-optimized Oz.Algorithms
	If you own this dependency, please, build it in RELEASE.
	If you don't, you can disable this policy by using 'config.With(ConfigOptions.DisableOptimizationsValidator)'.
Assembly Oz which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
